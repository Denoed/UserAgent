# UserAgent

***[Deno]*** *module providing access* <br>
*to the latest **UserAgents**.*

<br>
<br>

</div>

## Source

Fetched from **[Willshouse Techblog][Blog]** with more <br>
effort than necessary, since they don't seem to <br>
have a simple JSON endpoint. 

*Thanks to them, but they should add an endpoint.*

<br>
<br>

## Updates

There is currently no automated updating and <br>
I'm not even sure how problematic it would be, <br>
considering the usage of the WebView.

I added a UTC timestamp so <br>
you know how old the data is.
